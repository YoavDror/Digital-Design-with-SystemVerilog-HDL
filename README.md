# Digital Design with SystemVerilog HDL

## Overview
This repository contains **source code and design files** from my Udemy course  
[**Digital Design with SystemVerilog HDL**](https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-design-with-systemverilog-hdl/?referralCode=49ED68B87BEE54252BF4)

The folders include practical RTL examples that accompany the course lessons and allow learners to **run, simulate, and explore each design** exactly as demonstrated in the lectures.

---

## Course Content
Each lesson focuses on a specific digital design concept and includes:
- A **SystemVerilog design implementation**
- A **clear architecture diagram** of the design
- A corresponding **testbench** for simulation

The goal is to help students move from theory to **hands-on RTL design and simulation**, and to understand how real digital blocks behave cycle by cycle.

---

## Simulation
All designs can be simulated using **ModelSim**, as taught and demonstrated throughout the course.

Learners can:
- Compile the design and testbench
- Run simulations
- Inspect waveforms

---

## Final Project
At the end of the course, a **capstone project** brings together the material learned throughout the lectures.

### Final Project Description
- Design and implement a **serial communication system**
- Includes a **Transmitter (TX)** and **Receiver (RX)**
- Demonstrates:
  - Finite State Machines
  - Registers and counters
  - Data path and control logic
  - End-to-end system behavior

The project serves as a practical summary of the course, resulting in a **fully working digital system**.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is intended to:
- Provide students with **ready-to-run examples**
- Serve as a **reference** while taking the course
- Demonstrate a structured and professional approach to digital design using SystemVerilog
